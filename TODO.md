# TODO

- Context-sensitive articles: `a[n] [animal]`
- Pluralization:
	- Conditional: `[x=1-5] [item+$x]`
	- Unconditional: `[item+]`
- Case:
	- Preserve case
	- Lower case
	- Sentence case
	- Title case
	- Upper case
- Patterns vs. blocks:
	- Block content: all text in blocks (by default)
	- Pattern: double quotes
	- Literal: single quotes
- Parameterized rules:
	- Symbol definition: `greet(name)`
	- Rule definition: `Hi, [$name]!`
	- Invocation: `[greet('Bob')]`
- Escape characters: `\[not a block\]`
- Interactive mode:
	- Input prompts
	- Nicer formatting
	- Reuse the last input when a blank line is entered
- Notify about syntax errors nicely rather than throwing raw Python exceptions
- Flag to control whether unused variables are reset between lines
- Precompute rules to avoid running regex matches for every query
