# TODO

- Ordinals:
	- `[1-10](th)`
	- `[1-10.ordinal]`?
- Conditional pluralization: `[x=1-5] [item.s($x)]`
- Case:
	- Lower case: `[symbol]`
	- Title case: `[Symbol]`
	- Upper case: `[SYMBOL]`
- Patterns vs. blocks:
	- Special: all text in blocks (by default)
	- Pattern: double quotes
	- Literal: single quotes
	- Add single and double quotes to the stack when parsing
- Parameterized rules:
	- Symbol definition: `greet(name)`
	- Rule definition: `Hi, [$name]!`
	- Invocation: `[greet('Bob')]`
- Markov chains: `[name.markov]`
- Escape characters: `\[not a block\]`
	- Strip unescaped backslashes as a post-processing pass
- Interactive mode:
	- Input prompts
	- Nicer formatting
	- Reuse the last input when a blank line is entered
- Notify about syntax errors nicely rather than throwing raw Python exceptions
- Flag to control whether unused variables are reset between queries
- Precompute rules to avoid running regex matches for every query
- Make basic guesses at indefinite articles and plurals if inflect is not installed
